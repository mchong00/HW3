1) This was quite difficult for me. It just seemed like a huge difference in time spent from HW1 and HW2. I think I need to start earlier on the HWs now. There's a lot of stuff that wasn't covered in class, like reloadData to refresh the screen, etc. 


2) I watched a lot of youtube videos, but they all seem to use xib and not storyboards. Not sure what xib is. 


3) How were apps made previous to storyboards? I'm assuming no dragging and dropping with the wire frames, etc.
